# Entry 1: Millitary (And how it is innovated)
##### 10/14/25


## Why I Selected Milltary Techology

#### Reasons

The topic that I selected for the year long Freedom Project is Millitary and its innovations. To understand why I choose Millitary Tech, it comes from my shared passion of the **Sciences** and  **History**, espcappliy when considering how both topic infulence one another.  I felt that when adding together the topics of Science and History, one of the subtopics gotten from it should be millarty techolology, since it has scienficial and hisortical importance to it.

#### Research

To kickstart the research, some websites I looked into was ["Timeline: Weapons technology"](https://www.army.mil/article/242136/army_scientists_pick_top_10_coolest_advances_of_2020) and ["Army scientists pick top 10 coolest advances of 2020"](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17423-timeline-weapons-technology/). These two sites were for introducing the aspects of Millitary Techoloigy while relating to my other topic of History and Sciences. One site that I did find particulary helpful in understanding Milltary Techology impacts was ["Technology and the Nature of War"](https://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/technology-and-the-nature-of-war/) As it gave real life examples of how Millitary and its Techology are interconnected with each other to form real life stratiges. Another site that was pretty useful was ["Rise of the war machines: What drove the evolution of military technologies?"](https://bigthink.com/the-past/military-technologies-evolution-turchin/) as it gives a short and simple reason of what drives Millitary growth by a acclaimed Russian anthropologist, Peter Turchin. As I was reading through these sites, it further piqued my interest for look for more Millitary Tech and its Uses (which is what I did for another 3 hours.)
## EDP (Enginnering Design Process)

Right Now, I am in the first phase of the Enginnering Design Process, which is to define the problem. My main issue that I want to resolve is that **people tend to not see the effects Millitary Tech has on society**. The next stage is researching that problem which I somewhat started due to the implications of some websites I looked at. To further the next step, I would like to talk to my teacher about it to give an idea of what I can be using to help me on the next more websites that go in deeper about my problem.



## Skils I've Learned 
Some skills i've learning while working on the blog was **Googling** and  **skimming and Time Management** 

#### My Process for Googling

Now before even looking at the sites, something I also had to realize was, what did i need to Goggle? I asked this question because if ou didn't know what secpfiic thing you were finding on Goggle, then Goggle my give you results that you may not actully want. So instead of saying something general and blunt like, _"Millitary Tech"_, I started saying, _"The History of  Modern Millitary Tech"_
or if im looking for something more general or possibly more simpler to read, _"The Timeline of History tech"_.

#### Skimming  Time Management Process

This is an extension to Googling, but as I was looking through some sites that matched my topic. Some of these articles or websites were long. Like **_really really long_**. And through your goggle search, there are millions of websites or articles that meet your criteria. In school, we learned something known as MVP, or Mimium Viable Product. This means instead of loading yourself with something very complexy that would take loads of time, find something that meets the bare mimium of your critera. So I skimmed through the passages, looking for the general and important pieces of information and asked if they went into, and anwsered my questions. That thats how found what sources to use for the blog. 

#### Time mangement 

While I was working on the blog, I realized that the blog would take more time than usual work. For most of my homework, I would wait untill  6 or 7:00 pm (No refrence to this)  do it and finish it, preferring to use that time to play video games or look up history or chemistry topics. Not only that, but living far from my school doesnt give me a lot of time to work at it at home as i get home at around 4 pm by taking the school bus.  But in the case of the blog, I realized that process wouldnt work. So I started my homework sooner, at around 5:00 pm and on my bus ride, I made sure to do some thanks to a hotspot to further speed up my progress. By the time it was Sunday, the Blog was completly finished and with much time to spare.

## Next Steps

Nevertheless, I'm excited to look more into Millitary tech and its impacts. It feels nice knowing that I've found a topic that suits two passions in one!
