# Entry 1: Millitary (And how it is innovated)

## Why I Selected Milltary Techology

#### Reasons

The topic that I selected for the year long Freedom Project is Millitary and its innovations. To understand why I choose Millitary Tech, it comes from my shared passion of the **Sciences** and  **History**, espcappliy when considering how both topic infulence one another.  I felt that when adding together the topics of Science and History, one of the subtopics gotten from it should be millarty techolology, since it has scienficial and hisortical importance to it.

#### Research

To kickstart the research, some websites I looked into was ["Timeline: Weapons technology"](https://www.army.mil/article/242136/army_scientists_pick_top_10_coolest_advances_of_2020) and ["Army scientists pick top 10 coolest advances of 2020"](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17423-timeline-weapons-technology/). These two sites were for introducing the aspects of Millitary Techoloigy while relating to my other topic of History and Sciences. One site that I did find particulary helpful in understanding Milltary Techology impacts was ["Technology and the Nature of War"](https://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/technology-and-the-nature-of-war/) As it gave real life examples of how Millitary and its Techology are interconnected with each other to form real life stratiges. Another site that was pretty useful was ["Rise of the war machines: What drove the evolution of military technologies?"](https://bigthink.com/the-past/military-technologies-evolution-turchin/) as it gives a short and simple reason of what drives Millitary growth by a acclaimed Russian anthropologist, Peter Turchin. By using these sites it only made me more interested in learing Millitary Techologiy. 

## EDP (Enginnering Design Process)

Right Now, I am in the first phase of the Enginnering Design Process, which is to define the problem. My main issue that I want to resolve is that **people tend to not see the effects Millitary Tech has on society**. The next stage is researching that problem which I somewhat started due to the implications of some websites I looked at. To further the next step, I would like to talk to my teacher about it to give an idea of what I can be using to help me on the next more websites that go in deeper about my problem.



## Skils I've Learned 
Some skills i've learning while working on the blog was **Googling** and  **skimming and Time Management** 

#### My Process for Googling

Now before even looking at the sites, something I also had to realize was, what did i need to Goggle? 

#### Skimming  Time Management Process

This is an extension to Googling, but as I was looking through some sites that matched my topic. Some of these articles or websites were long. Like **_really really long_**. 

#### Time mangement 




## Next Steps

Nevertheless, I'm excited to look more into Millitary tech and its impacts. It feels nice knowing that I've found a topic that suits two passions in one!
